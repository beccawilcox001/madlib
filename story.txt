Once upon a time in a futuristic city, there lived a [strong] robot named [Jimmy]. 
[Jimmy] was not like the [other] robots that filled the city. 
Instead, [he] had [blue] [lights] and [pink] [wheels] that made [him] 
look incredibly [beautiful].

[Jimmy] spent [6] of [minutes] each day helping [clean] in the local [gym]. 
[He] had a [goofy] personality and always greeted everyone with a [scream]. 
[Jimmy] loved [screaming] in the [gym] and [kissing] [dogs] with [them].

One day, while [screaming] in the [gym], [Jimmy] discovered a [gross] [apple] hidden beneath some [weights]. 
[He] decided to [check] it out and was surprised to find a [wet] [battery] inside. [Jimmy] [ate] it 
[slowly] and [loved] it [happily]. Suddenly, the [fan] lit up, and [Jimmy] heard a [loud] voice saying, 
"[Jimmy], you are the chosen one. You have the power to [change] the world."

With newfound determination, [Jimmy] set out on an [big] adventure to [save] the world and make it a [better] place for 
[all]. Along the way, [he] made [8] of new [robot] friends who helped [him] [act] [quickly]. Together, they 
[walked] through [green] [library] and faced [horrible] challenges.

In the end, [Jimmy] realized that [his] [dream] was not defined by [his] [pink] [wheels], but by [his] 
[strong] [heart]. [He] had a heart of [steel], and that's what truly made [him] a [great] robot.

And so, [Jimmy] and [his] [smart] friends continued [saving] and [helping] the world, bringing 
[happiness] and [God] to everyone they met.

The end.
