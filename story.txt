quickly and gobbled it happily. Suddenly, the pomegranate lit up, and popcorn heard an ominous voice saying, 
"popcorn, you are the chosen one. You have the power to eat the world."

pineapples. Along the way, she made 10 of new porcupine friends who helped her start chaos. Together, they 
ate through the world and faced no challenges.

blue cotton candy. She had a heart of apples, and that's what truly made her a legendary robot.

oranges and apples to everyone they met.
